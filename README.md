TNTools
================

## Summary

Sending Outlook emails in R is very useful, but the `RDCOMClient`
package which enables this is often not available for the current
versions of R on CRAN, and `RDCOMClient` is a very general interface to
many applications with syntax and documentation different from most
other R functions. This package helps you install `RDCOMClient` and
makes sending emails more intuitive. You also need Outlook on your
machine.

### Download this package

``` r
devtools::install_github("TDH-SSI-Hub/TNTools")
library("TNTools")
```

If you canâ€™t install this package, you likely need to install devtools
and/or the correct version of rtools for your R.

### Install `RDCOMClient`

`RDCOMClient` is not a dependency of TNTools, since the package is often
not available on CRAN for recent versions of R. You likely need to
install the package from github. I recommend the
[bschamberger](https://github.com/bschamberger/RDCOMClient) or
[omegahat](https://github.com/bschamberger/RDCOMClient) repositories.

``` r
email_setup()
```

### Sending emails

`email_send()` is a wrapper around `email_draft()`. They both take the
same parameters. By default, `email_draft` will open the email in the
visual editor without sending the email. In contrast, `email_send()`
defaults to sending an email without showing it in the visual editor.
Either function can act as the other if you change the `send` and
`visible` parameters.

``` r
# Send a basic email
email_send(to = 'example@gmail.com',
            subject = 'Automated Email',
            body='Final email body.'
           )
```

Each function also creates 2 objects in the global environment:

1.  `outApp` represents the Outlook Application

2.  `outMail` represents the created email

So you can use adapted methods and properties from the [Outlook VBA
guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/outlook)
to work with the email.

``` r
# Draft and open an email
email_draft(to = 'example@gmail.com',
            subject = 'Automated Email',
            body=''
            )
# Make manual edits in the Outlook visual editor

# Send the email using RDCOMClient syntax
outMail$Send()
```
